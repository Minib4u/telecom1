 Telecom Churn Analysis Project – Summary
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data from a telecom company to identify trends, business opportunities, and customer retention strategies using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

🔍 Key Objectives:
Identify best-performing regions based on customer count.

Measure sales performance by analyzing active (non-churned) customers.

Perform data exploration and cleaning.

Analyze the churn rate and investigate factors affecting churn.

Dataset Used:
File: churn_all.csv

Contains customer-level data such as:

CustomerID

State

Churn status

Possibly demographic and service usage attributes (e.g., minutes used, charges, etc.)

📈 Sample Analyses Performed:
State-wise coverage: Used value counts to find the top states by number of customers.

Sales performance: Filtered customers with Churn == 'No' to calculate the number of active users.

Churn analysis: (Likely continued in later parts of the notebook) would involve comparing churned vs non-churned customers on usage, tenure, or service features.
